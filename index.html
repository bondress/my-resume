            <h2>Hi! &#128516</h2>
            <p class="intro">Currently, I own a Tutoring Business called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lightmanor_acad/">LightManor Academy</a> where I tutor students online (Abuja only) and offline (Worldwide). I am also taking a Post-Graduate Diploma in Software Engineering Course at <a href="https://niitabuja.com/">NIIT Abuja</a>. In addition to all this awesome stuff, I am a Church Administrator, Worship Leader, Singer/Songwriter, Budding Pianist/Keyboardist, Scrabble Enthusiast and a Chartered Banker. I strongly believe that I can impact my world positively through Technology and I'm very interested in working remotely with Teams that share those values.</p>

                    <h3>Design and Development</h3>
                    <p>I started learning to code when I was 16 years old because I won a scholarship at my High School for being the Best Computing Student in my year. Over time, I have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience designing and developing desktop, mobile and web applications.</p>
                    <img class="teaching-img" src="images/teaching.gif" alt="animated teacher">
                    <h3>Teaching</h3>
                    <p>I am absolutely passionate about teaching. I believe this helps me to be a better programmer. I was inspired to become a teacher by one of my lecturers in University, Mr. Oguntodu (May his soul rest in peace). I will keep teaching until I can no longer talk anymore.</p>
                    <img class="music-img" src="images/music.gif" alt="animated musical note">
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>No one on this planet loves music as much as I do. I love to sing (I'm a worship leader, the Convener of True Worship Sessions), I appreciate great music and I even write songs of my own. It is my absolute favourite pastime. If you want to stay on my good side, DO. NOT. INTERRUPT. MY. MUSIC. &#128540</p>
